//jwt token
/*we want to return a Jason web token Once user registers
 so that way we can use that token to authenticate
and access protected routes.(from the client)
The second part of the token is the payload
That's the data that we want to send within the token (example the name of the user)
what we want to send as the payload in our case is the I.D. the user's I.D. so that we can identify
which user it is with the token.
That way if we want to let's say update our profile we can easily look at that payload and see which
user it is that's logged in and which user's profile we have to update.

the way that this works is with the Jason Webb token package that we have installed,
we need to first sign it and we pass in our payload back and then we can have a callback or we send a response
back to the client with that token.

And then later on, we need to protect our roots by creating a piece of middleware that will
verify the token.

So if we go down here we can call JWT dot verify with the token that sent in.

It's going to get sent in through the HTTP headers and we can verify it and then either allow the user

to access if it verifies or send back a response if says token is invalid.
